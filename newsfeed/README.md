## 1: A Article Sequence file

This file contains a list of article file names.
Their sequence represents the order in which they will appear in the news feed. News articles not listed in this file will not be shown.

## 2: News Article Files

Each entry in the _Article Sequence File_ must correspond to a news article file. News article files are written in [markdown](https://markdown-it.github.io/).
