# Video: How do Danes behave during the Corona crisis?

We are now facing the Corona crisis with great consequences to follow both for the individual and society as a whole. Professor in Social Science, Michael Bang Petersen, has been given a Semper Ardens-grant to research social behaviour during the crisis, where Denmark in many ways have been turned into an anthropological laboratory available for "real-time"-study. In this video, Bang Petersen introduces the research project that is funded by Carlsbergfondet.
