# Additional grant from Carlsberg Foundation

The HOPE project was awarded an additional 2.4 million DKK from the **Carlsberg Foundation**. This funding supports day-to-day collection of data on the behavior of the Danish public. The data will be transferred to Statens Serum Institut for use in models of the spread of infection based on, among other, populational behavior.
