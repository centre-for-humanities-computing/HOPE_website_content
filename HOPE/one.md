The COVID-19 pandemic is the largest sudden crisis for Western democracies since the Second World War. Funded by 25 million DKK from the Carlsberg Foundation, the HOPE project examines the interrelationship between:

 - the trajectory of the COVID-19
 - the decisions of governments and international organisations
 - the decisions of media and social media landscapes 
 - citizensâ€™ behavior and well-being
