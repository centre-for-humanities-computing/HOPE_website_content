# HOPE / Home page

user quote:

```json
% A lean main page, which introduces the project in just a few sentences and provides
an overview of all main activities. I let you figure out how to organize the four links
to detailed above. I could imagine just avery simple bullet list, but if you can, 
please be creative and create some sort of a more fancy scheme. E.g. I could imagine
something like four tiles, where each tile is some sort of a picture or a visualization.
I also could imagine that the four tiles are all boxes of info, e.g. list of blog posts, 
publications. It should not be too busy, however.
