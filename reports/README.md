# Reports

user quote:
```
% short (3-5paragraph) analyses aimed at the public. A quick look at the data, 
or a summary of a publication/preprint etc. It would be a blog in the sense 
that things would be chronologically ordered, with the latest things on top. We 
could use tags to help navigation between similar analyses. 
```


Reports are described by two types of files

## 1: Report Sequence File

This file contains a list of report file names. 
Each report file name should be on its own line. Their sequence represents the order in which they will appear in the news feed. New entries should appear in __chronological order with the latest things on top__ (always add new entries to the top of the file). 

Reports not listed in here will not appear as content on the page.

## 2: Report Files

Each line in the _Entry Sequence File_ must correspond to a report file. Report files are written in [markdown](https://markdown-it.github.io/).
