# Reports

The reports are described by two types of files

## 1: A Entry Sequence File

This file contains a list of article file names. 
Their sequence represents the order in which they will appear in the news feed. New entries should appear in __chronological order with the latest things on top__ (always add new entries to the top of the file). 

Reports not listed in here will not appear as content on the page.

## 2: Report Files

Each entry in the _Entry Sequence File_ must correspond to a report file. Report files are written in [markdown](https://markdown-it.github.io/).
